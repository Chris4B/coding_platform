📂 Project Structure

Here's how the project is organized for maintainability and scalability:

src/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components (buttons, headers, etc.)
├── features/        # Organized by features, each with components & Redux slices
├── layouts/         # Page structures and reusable layouts
├── pages/           # Main pages mapped to application routes
├── routes/          # React Router configurations
├── store/           # Redux store and middlewares
├── styles/          # Global styles and Material-UI theme configuration
├── utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
└── assets/          # Static files like images and icons

Each folder includes its own README.md file for detailed information. 🗂️

Voici une proposition pour un README global attractif et bien structuré pour votre projet, avec des badges et des éléments visuels pour attirer l'attention :
