# 🛠️ Utils Directory

The **Utils** directory is your toolbox! 🧰

Inside, you'll find:
- 🌐 `api.js`: Manage API calls with ease.
- 📋 `constants.js`: Keep your constants centralized.
- 🧠 `helpers.js`: Handy utility functions for common tasks.

This is where you keep things DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)! 💡
