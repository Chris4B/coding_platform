# 🚀 Features Directory

The **Features** directory is where the magic happens! 🪄✨

Each sub-folder represents a feature of the app and includes:
- 🧩 Specific components tied to the feature.
- 🔧 Redux slices to manage state.

Examples of features:
- 🔐 Authentication
- 📊 Dashboard
- 📚 Lessons

Organize your features for clean, scalable development! 💡
